# Cloud deployment example

This repository provide a simple example on how to deploy a single file trame application onto a CapRover instance using the git approach.

## Background

When creating a single file application with trame the only files that you need to edit for your specific needs are:
- `app.py`: Should contain your own application code with a `__main__` section
- `./setup/requirements.txt`: Should list all your dependencies including `trame`
- `./setup/apps.yaml`: Should add any additional args/parameters you may need for your app. Or list all the app you want to deploy at once.

Generic file that don't needs edits:
- `Dockerfile`: contains the basic multi-user setup for trame apps.
- `captain-definition` Point to the dockerfile for building the deployment.

## CapRover endpoint setup

Within the CapRover web interface, for your application make sure you enable `"WebSocket Support"` at the bottom of the `"HTTP Settings"` page. 

Then ideally you should also __Enable HTTPS__ and check __Force HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS__

## How to deploy

The idea is to rely directly on git so in order to deploy such repository, you should be able to run the following command lines:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kitware/trame-app-cone.git
cd trame-app-cone
caprover deploy
```

Then follow the flow of the questions to finish the deployment.

```bash
Preparing deployment to CapRover...

? select the CapRover machine name you want to deploy to: xyz
Ensuring authentication...
? CapRover machine password: [hidden]
? select the app name you want to deploy to: cone
? git branch name to be deployed: main
? note that uncommitted and gitignored files (if any) will not be pushed to server! Are you sure you want to deploy? Yes

Saving tar file to: ".../temporary-captain-to-deploy.tar"

## Multi-app

Now sphere and cone can be accesssed from within the same deployment. One is under `/cone.html` and the other one under `/sphere.html`.
